You just found my work account that is used exclusively for work-related projects. I am currently employed at **Microsoft** as a **Principal Product Manager** in the Identity SDK team. This is the team, that among other things, builds the **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/)**.

You might want to check out [my personal account](https://github.com/dend) instead to learn about public (external-facing) projects I work on. Not that you can't follow this one too - there is some great Microsoft-related stuff here.

While at it, stop by [my blog](https://den.dev).
