You just found my work account that is used exclusively for work-related projects. I am currently employed at **Microsoft** as a **Principal Product Manager** in the Identity SDK team. This is the team, that among other things, builds the **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/)**.

This is as much as I can share publicly about what I do. If you work at Microsoft and want to partner on any of the items above, **[send me a note](#contact)**.

| | Details |
|:---|:---|
| <img src="/media/computer.png" width="64px" /> | I am the product manager (PM) for **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/dotnet/)** and **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Go](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/go/)**. |
| <img src="/media/write.png" width="64px" /> | I write for the **[Microsoft Entra Identity Developer Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/identity/)**. |
| <img src="/media/comms.png" width="64px" /> | I am engaging with the community building applications using MSAL **[on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-ad-msal)**, and wherever the community is. |
| <img src="/media/samples.png" width="64px" /> | I help write code samples and **[documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/)** that helps developers get started with the MSAL family of libraries. One of the projects I help with right now is moving all the Wiki content from GitHub to Microsoft Learn. |
| <img src="/media/data.png" width="64px" /> | I dig through data to help folks using MSAL optimize their usage. |
| <img src="/media/recycle.png" width="64px" /> | I am **[helping our customers migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-migration)** from our old library (Azure Active Directory Authentication Library, or ADAL for short) to the modern MSAL stack. |
| <img src="/media/die.png" width="64px" /> | I engage closely with our internal and external customers and partners to design maintainable APIs for our portfolio of SDKs. |
