# I am Den ðŸ‘‹

You just found my work account that is mainly used by some automatically running scripts and random internal documentation changes. You might want to check out [my personal account](https://github.com/dend) instead to learn about public projects I work on.

And of course, stop by [my blog](https://den.dev).
